# Introduction to Git and GitHub
This project replaces interest-based calculations with a profit-sharing model
to illustrate alternative ethical financial logic.

## Halal Profit-Sharing Calculator (Interest-Free)

A simple calculator that demonstrates an **interest-free, profit-based financial model**.
Instead of using interest, this project follows a **profit-sharing approach**, where returns
are derived from actual economic outcomes rather than time-based capital growth.

This example is intended for **educational purposes only**.
Input:
c, capital invested
p, total profit generated
s, investor profit share percentage

Output:
investor_profit = p × (s / 100)
final_capital = c + investor_profit

### Key Principles
- No interest (riba)
- No guaranteed return
- Profit linked to real activity
- Risk-sharing model
